# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This project is a website that acts as a study guide for the prework of the upcoming coding boot camp at UT. My motivation for this project was to find a way to stay on top of all my notes so I can show up prepared to the first day of the boot camp. This project solves the problem of having to go back into the coursework to search for notes to study, as I now have a place to keep all of my notes. Throughout this project, I learned the importance of syntax in HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I also learned how to input commands into my computer using GitBash, how to create a document using HTML, how to style a sheet with CSS, and how to make it interactive using JavaScript functions.

## Usage

This website can be used to store any and all notes that have been taken in the prework section of the bootcamp, so that it is organized neatly and easily accessible. There are many components to this website, some of which are more complicated than others. A simple HTML document was used to create the framework of this website, which consists of a head that holds all the metadata and invisible elements to the page; and a body that contains all the visible information of this webpage. This document was styled using a separate CSS sheet which was then linked to the HTML document. This took care of all the visual aesthetics of the page, including the colors, padding, margins, and font type/size. We were then able to add some simple Javascript functions and For loops linked to the HTML document as well.
